## [Four Pillars of OOP](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-4-pillars-of-OOPs):
1. Encapsulation
2. Abstraction
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation is a process of binding data members (variables, properties) and member functions (methods) together. In OOP, we achieve encapsulation through Class.

### Abstraction
Abstraction is the process of showing only essential/necessary features of an entity/object to the outside world and hide the other irrelevant information.

### Inheritance
The process of creating the new class by extending the the existing class is called inheritance or the process of inheriting the features of base class is called as inheritance.

### Polymorphism
Poly means many and Morph means forms. Polymorphism is the process in which an object or function take different forms. It is a feature, which lets us create functions with same name but different arguments, which will perform differently. That is function with same name, functioning in different way. Or, it also allows us to redefine a function to provide its new definition.
